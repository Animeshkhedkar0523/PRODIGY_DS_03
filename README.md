# PRODIGY_DS_03
# Task 03 - Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

## 🧪 Dataset Used
- **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
